# Super Fun Mini Games Collection 🎮💖

## Hey there, Game Lover! 🌟

Welcome to my super cool Mini Games Collection project! This is where the fun begins with three awesome games: Hangman, Guess the Word, and Guess the Number. Get ready to have a blast and test your skills!

## What's Inside? 🤩

### Hangman 🧩

- We randomly pick a word from our stash.
- You get to guess the letters and complete the mystery word.
- But be quick - you've got a limited number of tries!
- It's like being a word detective, and it's so much fun!

### Guess the Word 🤓

- We give you a jumbled-up word to solve.
- Don't worry; we'll drop hints and let you have multiple tries.
- Can you unscramble the puzzle and guess the word?
- Keep track of how many tries it takes you!

### Guess the Number 🔢

- We'll generate a random number within a set range.
- Your job is to guess that elusive number.
- We'll tell you if you're too high or too low.
- Keep guessing until you hit the jackpot!
- Let's see how good your number skills are!
